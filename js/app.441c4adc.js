This caused issues with data duplication and loss, so we had to use a combination of React states, refs, and effects to properly manage the re-renders. We found that states always forced a render, refs never re-render, and effects conditionally re-render when one of the dependencies updates, so we placed the WebSockets in a ref and the data in states, and then added the WebSocket listeners in an effect so that the functionality would adapt to changes in the application data.

When we began implementing the checklist items on cards, we decided that it would be more effective to switch to a non-relational database so that we could allocate separate documents for each card with the column, tasks, and messages all stored in a single location.

My fondest memories involve playing games with friends, especially ones that drew everyone in and got them involved. Mafia was always the epitome of this. I love how it tests acting skills and analytical skills and how it sometimes erupts into heated back and fourths. However, it does come with a caveat, one person has to sit out to moderate the game. It struck me that the moderator’s tasks are completely robotic, so why shouldn’t a robot do them? This exactly what I came to fix, with this app everyone can join in the game and the software does the technical work. Additionally, it avoids the long periods where players have to keep their eyes closed as they wait for others to go. Mafia seems like it was meant to have an app. So here it is, the code runs the game while the players get to focus on playing. In order to do this project I had to learn Swift, Firebase, and GitHub. But more generally, I learned how to develop the front-end and back-end of an app. These skills are valuable and will continue to come in handy. In the beginning I was unsure of how to structure the project. I wasn’t yet familiar with app development so it was difficult to predict how long each thing would take. In the end however, a wonderful structure fell into place. The first few work-cycles were spent implementing the fundamentals of an app, both on the front-end and back-end. The remaining cycles were spent implementing the game. This was done in three parts; One, writing out the game logic on paper; Two, creating game-play functions that communicate with the back-end; Three, creating the game itself. This turned out to be a great structure and I plan to return to it in future app development.

In addition to these main commands, this bot also has others such as: /help, /server, /user, and "ping". /help outputs the current commands, /server outputs the server the command was run in, /user outputs the user the command was run by, and "ping" is a basic command that replies with pong.

From there, I focused on the functionality and specific features of the app. Then, towards the end of each sprint, this is when I worked on styling the app. I tended to focus on tasks that I thought would take a longer time during the earlier sprints, leaving the last sprint full of tasks I already knew how to do.
