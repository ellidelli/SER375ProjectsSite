          It is a two part project that has the goal of being a one part
          project.

          <h1>Part 1</h1>
          The first part is a website built with react and express.js.
          The goal of the site is to be a place holder website for a webGL game.
          The site currently is set up with websocket room and chat
          functionality and users joined display (Shown in photos).

        The idea originated from wanting to get a deeper understanding and practical experience with 
        websockets and game development. In order to complete that task I had to learn about websockets,
        unity mulitplayer developement, and C#.

          The biggest struggle was understanding how to code for the unity multiplayer solution 
          netcode for gameobjects. This was due to not having prior experience with server and client 
          side code being contained in the same file.
