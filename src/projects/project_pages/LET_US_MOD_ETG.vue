      <template v-slot:description>
        <p>This is a mod for Enter the Gungeon titled Let Us Mod in the Gungeon.
          This mod consists of two mod packs, one that has weapons and items, the other has a custom character, both are
          from my SER225 project LetUsCook.
          The original SER225 project was heavily inspired by Enter the Gungeon</p>

      <template v-slot:story>
        <p>This project came from my love of roguelike video games,
          which led me to create LetUsCook, a roguelike in the fall semester of
          2023. When given the opportunity to work
          on an open source project, I knew I had to do something with Enter the Gungeon</p>

      <template v-slot:strugglesAndTriumphs>
        <p>There was a lot of struggling in this project. For one,
          although there is a large modding community along with modding tools,
          there was one little problem... they were all for Windows computers...
          and I have a Mac. After a time of struggling with different virtual desktops,
          I was graciously allowed to borrow a PC laptop from Professor Thimminer. Along with the Mac mess,
          I also had momentary blockages, but when consulting the modding community through their Discord, all of them got
          fixed!</p>
