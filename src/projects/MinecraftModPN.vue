                    <h1>Desription</h1>
                    This Minecraft mod covers multiple aspects of the game from custom key binding, all the way to eating a new strawberry item.
                    There is a new creative tab menu that has all of the new materials, blocks and items that were added in the mod.
                    
                    <h1>New Mods</h1>
                    The new items,blocks, etc. are: 
                    strawberries/strawberry crop,ignitium ore, ignitium block, jump block, water hud, new lamp block, 
                    3 new paintings, ore generation across 3 dimensions, and a new custom key bind.
                </p>

                    <h1>Why I chose this</h1>
                    Minecraft has always been my favorite game since I was a little kid. I figured since we've been learning java since freshman year,
                    modding Minecraft 1.19 java edition would be a fun challenge, and give me a reason to play more Minecraft.

                    <h1>What I had to learn</h1>
                    The first thing I had to learn was how to install forge, and then start learning how to create and register items and blocks.
                    Once I got familiar with adding items and blocks I started adding custom mechanics. Once I learned those couple things everything
                    became a lot easier.

                    <h1>Something I struggled with and my greatest triumph</h1>
                    The major struggle I had was adding ore generation. This took me multiple days, and a ton of attempts before finally getting everything
                    right. With all of the new files that I had to add, this opened a lot of opportunity for typos and other simple mistakes. When I got to
                    the end of making ore generation, the Ender ore wouldn't display the correct texture. I spent hours and hours changing things, only for
                    the error to be a missing underscore.
                    My greatest Triumph during this was making the textures. I'm not very good at art and color theory, but I feel like I really outdid my
                    usual standards.
